    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we'll go through a short quiz containing the types of questions about SQL and relational databases that you can expect to see in an interview. \n",

    "## SQL Interview Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "what are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "REAL\n",
    "TEXT\n",
    "BLOB\n",
    "INTEGER\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Primary Keys are keys of the particular table, and as keys must have a unique value for all entries in the table.\n",
    "Foreign Keys are primary keys of a different table and can be used to Join two tables together.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-One: a single entry in one table matches up to a single entry in another table. Joined tables will have the same length as both of the original tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "One-to-Many: a single entry in one table relates to several entries in the second table. The resulting Join would be as long as the larger table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many-to-Many: several entries in the first table match to several entries in the second table. The resulting Join would be much larger than the original tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "LeftJoin - The first table is the primary and the second is matched up to it\n",
    "RightJoin - The second table is the primary and the first is matched up to it\n",
    "InnerJoin - The Join table only contains entries that exist in both tables\n",
    "OuterJoin - The Join table only contains entries that do not exist in both tables\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregate functions tell SQL how to return our Grouped results. For example, I can want to find the count of entries in a particular group, or I can want to find out the sum of the entries in that group. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
